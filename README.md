# SQL-Project---Education-for-All
As a Data Analyst working for the charity, Education for All. I have been asked by the Head of Fundraising to present the data on donor insights and donation rates. 
Within the Fundraising team, our objectives are to:
• Increase the number of donors in our database
• Increase the donation frequency of our donors.
• Increase the value of donations in our database.
In two weeks our team is having a fundraising strategy meeting for the following year, and I need to present insights from the donation data to inform
 them on fundraising strategies to increase donations.
